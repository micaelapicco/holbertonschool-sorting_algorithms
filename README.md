- Sorting algorithms are fundamental algorithms used to arrange elements in a particular order, typically in ascending or descending order. The efficiency of a sorting algorithm is often measured using Big O notation, which describes the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm. 

- Big O notation provides a high-level understanding of the growth rate of algorithms as the input size increases. It helps in comparing algorithms and making informed choices based on the expected efficiency requirements.
## Learning Objectives
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `sort.h`
## Functions
- **sort.h**,  header file
- **bubble_sort**,  function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
- **insertion_sort_list**,  function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
- **selection_sort**,  function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
- **quick_sort**, function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
- **print_array**, function that prints array
- **print_list**, function that prints list
